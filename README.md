# C# OOP Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the four fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C#:

- **Abstraction**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

C# is a powerful, object-oriented programming language that allows for the development of complex and maintainable applications. This project shows how OOP principles are applied to create a flexible and scalable software architecture.

## OOP Principles Explained

### 1. Abstraction

**Abstraction** is the process of modeling relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system. This allows the system to focus on the essential properties and functionalities.

In this project, I used abstraction to define base classes and interfaces that represent the essential attributes and behavior of the system, making it easier to work with complex data structures.

### 2. Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** refers to the concept of hiding the internal state and functionality of an object, allowing access only through a set of public methods. This keeps the data safe from unintended modification and enforces a clean separation of concerns.

In this project, fields are kept private, and they are accessed or modified using getter and setter methods to enforce encapsulation.

### 3. Inheritance

**Inheritance** allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. This helps to reduce redundancy and increase reusability by enabling you to define common functionality in a base class, which can then be inherited by derived classes.

### 3. Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** allows methods and properties to take many forms. Specifically, you can override inherited properties or methods to provide different implementations in derived classes.
